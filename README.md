# Better Pip Uninstall
### A shell script to uninstall python packages (installed with pip) & it's unused dependencies
### Don't actually use this (unless you want to I guess it's kinda scuffed)
### The [pip-autoremove](https://pypi.org/project/pip-autoremove/) package already does this very well. This is just something I made for fun.
