# Better Pip Uninstall
### Scuffed shell script to uninstall python packages (installed with pip) & their unused dependencies
### [pip-autoremove](https://pypi.org/project/pip-autoremove/) does this much better, I just made this for fun

## Running tests
### Run the tests (`/test/run_test.sh`) in a python venv to avoid important packages from being removed (if it fails)
